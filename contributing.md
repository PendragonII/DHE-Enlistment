## Contributing:
You may propose edits using [pull requests](https://github.com/PendragonII/DHE-Enlistment/pulls) or [opening an issue](https://github.com/PendragonII/DHE-Enlistment/issues/new/choose). 

Opening a pull request will create a copy of the files which you modify (easier than you may think) then propose as a change. There is no programming knowledge required to modify and propose. Click [Pull request](https://github.com/PendragonII/DHE-Enlistment/pulls) then click *New pull request.*

To list new users:

`- [USER NAME](https://namemc.com/profile/UUID)`

User's UUID can be found from [NameMC](https://namemc.com/). Search the username, click copy UUID, then replace the UUID with the User's UUID in the above example link.

Exmaple:\
From: `https://namemc.com/profile/UUID`\
To: `https://namemc.com/profile/d4e6b6cb-1371-4486-bbf3-5d71a53a9c50`

Now when a user changes their username, the [NameMC](https://namemc.com/) link will still work :wink:
