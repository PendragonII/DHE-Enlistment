To list new users:

`- [USER NAME](https://namemc.com/profile/UUID)`

User's UUID can be found from [NameMC](https://namemc.com/). Search the username, click copy UUID, then replace the UUID with the User's UUID in the above example link.

Exmaple:\
From: `https://namemc.com/profile/UUID`\
To: `https://namemc.com/profile/d4e6b6cb-1371-4486-bbf3-5d71a53a9c50`

Now when a user changes their username, the [NameMC](https://namemc.com/) link will still work :wink:
