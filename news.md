## 2020 May

The End Dimension is resetting on 2020 May 31st. All lengonaries shall attend with best fitting armor at the reborn End Dimension to slay the Ender Dragon and claim the Egg. DHE shall gain both Dragon Eggs in a glorious display of might.


Vampires and DHE Enemies will undoubtably be present. Health potions, Speed potions, Obsidian or other high level armor, and crossbows will be necessary.

[XxTomasVxX](https://namemc.com/profile/1d408d8c-0818-4a92-9dac-078e7691dbfd) will be giving ownership of the Dragon Egg until we place it somewhere in Purtania. With fighting alongside the DHE you agree with this condition.

This event will occur on _2020 May 31_, 4pm (16:00) BST, [compare your time zone](https://time.is/BST).


_Long live Purtania!_
